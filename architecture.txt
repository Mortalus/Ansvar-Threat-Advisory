Looking at your threat modeling pipeline project, I can see it's become quite complex with 50+ files mixing concerns. Let me propose a cleaner, more scalable architecture.
Architecture Recommendations
Technology Stack
Backend: FastAPI + Python

Replace Flask with FastAPI for better async support, automatic API documentation, and type safety
Built-in WebSocket support without additional libraries
Pydantic for data validation and serialization
Background task queue (Celery with Redis) for long-running pipeline steps

Frontend: Next.js 14+ with TypeScript

App Router for better performance and simpler routing
Server Components for initial data loading
Built-in API routes if needed
Tailwind CSS for rapid, consistent styling
Shadcn/ui for modern, accessible components
Zustand for lightweight state management

Database: PostgreSQL + Redis

PostgreSQL for persistent storage (projects, results, reviews)
Redis for caching, session management, and task queue
Prisma ORM for type-safe database access

Key Architectural Principles

Clear Separation of Concerns

API handles business logic only
Frontend handles presentation only
Shared package for common types


Event-Driven Pipeline

Each step publishes events
UI subscribes to events via WebSocket
Steps can run independently


Modular Services

One service per pipeline step
Services communicate through well-defined interfaces
Easy to test and modify independently



Modern UI DesignModern Threat Modeling UI DesignInteractive artifact Implementation Roadmap
Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)

Set up monorepo structure with Turborepo
Initialize FastAPI backend with basic endpoints
Create Next.js app with Tailwind + Shadcn/ui
Set up PostgreSQL + Prisma schema
Implement authentication (if needed)

Phase 2: Core Pipeline (Week 3-4)

Migrate pipeline services to FastAPI
Implement Celery for background tasks
Create WebSocket connections for real-time updates
Build pipeline UI components
Add file upload with progress tracking

Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Week 5-6)

Implement review system with optimistic UI
Add threat visualization (graphs, diagrams)
Create export functionality
Add search and filtering
Implement user preferences

Key Design Principles

Visual Hierarchy

Purple/blue gradient accents for primary actions
Dark theme with subtle animations
Clear step progression visualization


Real-time Feedback

Live progress indicators
WebSocket updates for each step
Toast notifications for key events


Responsive States

Loading skeletons
Error boundaries with retry
Empty states with clear CTAs


Accessibility

ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
High contrast ratios
Focus indicators



This architecture will give you:

Scalability: Easy to add new pipeline steps or features
Maintainability: Clear separation of concerns
Performance: Async processing, caching, optimized builds
Developer Experience: Type safety, hot reload, great tooling
