Test System Architecture Document

This document describes a simple web application architecture:

External Entities:
- Users: Web application users who login and access data
- Admin: System administrators who manage the application

Processes:
- Authentication Service: Handles user login with database queries for credential verification
- Payment Processor: Processes credit card transactions and handles payment data  
- User Database: Stores user credentials, profiles, and authentication data

Data Flows:
- Users send login credentials to Authentication Service via HTTPS
- Authentication Service queries User Database for credential verification
- Payment Processor handles sensitive payment data and stores transaction records
- Admin users access system logs and user management functions

Trust Boundaries:
- Internet to DMZ boundary
- DMZ to Internal Network boundary
- Application to Database boundary

This system processes user authentication, payment data, and maintains user profiles.
