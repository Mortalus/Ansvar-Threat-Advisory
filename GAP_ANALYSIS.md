3. **Threat Feedback System** - Learning mechanism
4. **Multi-tenant Support** - Client isolation
5. **Celery Task Integration** - Background job processing
6. **Pipeline State Management** - Complex state handling

### New Features to Implement
1. **React Router** - Replace Next.js routing
2. **State Management** - Zustand/Redux for complex state
3. **API Client Enhancement** - Robust error handling
4. **File Upload Security** - Virus scanning, type validation
5. **Caching Strategy** - Performance optimization
6. **Testing Framework** - Jest/Vitest setup

### API Integration Requirements
1. **Authentication Flow** - JWT token management
2. **WebSocket Connection** - Real-time updates
3. **File Upload** - Multipart form handling
4. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error states
5. **Request Retry Logic** - Network resilience
6. **Response Caching** - Performance optimization

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **Data Loss** - During migration
2. **Authentication Breach** - Security vulnerabilities
3. **WebSocket Stability** - Real-time connection issues
4. **State Management** - Complex workflow states

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Migration** - Phase-by-phase approach
2. **Comprehensive Testing** - Unit, integration, E2E
3. **Security Audits** - Regular security reviews
4. **Rollback Plan** - Quick recovery mechanism

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)
- Framework setup (Vite + React)
- Routing implementation
- Authentication system
- API client setup

### Phase 2: Essential Features (Week 2)
