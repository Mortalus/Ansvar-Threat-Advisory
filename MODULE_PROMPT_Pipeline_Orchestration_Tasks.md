User: Excellent. Now let's analyze the Pipeline Orchestration & Tasks module.

Here is the relevant code from the following files: apps/api/app/api/endpoints/pipeline.py, apps/api/app/core/pipeline/manager.py, apps/api/app/tasks/pipeline_tasks.py, apps/api/app/api/endpoints/tasks.py, apps/api/app/models/pipeline.py

Your Task: Analyze this code and list the specific user-facing or API-level functionalities it provides. Be precise. For example: "Create pipeline", "Execute step (sync/background)", "List pipelines", "Get pipeline status", "Cancel/delete pipeline", "Get step result", "Enqueue single step", "Enqueue full pipeline", "Task status/list/stats/health", "WebSocket progress notifications".
