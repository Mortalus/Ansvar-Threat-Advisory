E-commerce Web Application Security Architecture

This document describes the security architecture for an e-commerce web application.

Components:
- Web Frontend: React-based customer interface running on Nginx
- API Gateway: Handles authentication and request routing
- User Service: Manages user accounts and authentication
- Product Service: Manages product catalog and inventory
- Order Service: Processes customer orders and payments
- Database: PostgreSQL database storing user data, products, and orders
- Payment Gateway: External Stripe integration for processing payments

Security Controls:
- HTTPS encryption for all communications
- JWT tokens for authentication
- Input validation on all API endpoints
- SQL injection prevention using parameterized queries
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Multi-factor authentication for admin users

Trust Boundaries:
- Internet to DMZ: Customer traffic
- DMZ to Internal Network: API calls between services
- Internal Network to Database: Service-to-database communications
