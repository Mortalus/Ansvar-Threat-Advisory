User: Excellent. Now let's analyze the Documents & DFD Processing module.

Here is the relevant code from the following files: apps/api/app/api/endpoints/documents.py, apps/api/app/core/pipeline/dfd_extraction_service.py, apps/api/app/core/pipeline/steps/dfd_extraction_enhanced.py, apps/api/app/core/pipeline/steps/dfd_quality_enhancer.py

Your Task: Analyze this code and list the specific user-facing or API-level functionalities it provides. Be precise. For example: "Upload documents with PDF/TXT extraction and token estimates", "Extract STRIDE-focused data", "Review/update extracted security data", "Extract DFD (enhanced/basic) with quality report", "Review/update DFD components", "Generate threats", "Refine threats", "Analyze attack paths", "Get sample DFD".
