E-Commerce Platform Architecture Document
Version: 2.0
Date: January 2025

System Overview:
Our e-commerce platform is a modern web application that allows customers to browse products, manage shopping carts, and complete purchases online. The system integrates with multiple payment providers and shipping partners.

Architecture Components:

External Users and Systems:
- Customers: End users who browse and purchase products
- Store Administrators: Internal users who manage inventory and orders
- Payment Gateway (Stripe): External payment processing service
- Shipping API (FedEx/UPS): External shipping providers
- Email Service (SendGrid): External email notification service

Core Processes:
- Web Application Server: Next.js frontend application
- API Gateway: Node.js Express server handling all API requests
- Authentication Service: Auth0 integration for user authentication
- Order Processing Service: Handles order workflow and validation
- Inventory Management Service: Tracks product availability
- Notification Service: Manages email and SMS notifications

Data Stores:
- User Database (PostgreSQL): Stores customer profiles and credentials
- Product Catalog (MongoDB): Stores product information and metadata
- Order Database (PostgreSQL): Stores order history and transactions
- Session Cache (Redis): Stores active user sessions
- Image Storage (AWS S3): Stores product images and media

Trust Boundaries:
- Internet DMZ: Public-facing web servers
- Application Tier: Internal application servers
- Database Tier: Protected database servers
- Third-party Services: External API integrations

Data Flows:

1. Customer Login Flow:
   - Customer sends credentials to Web Application Server via HTTPS
   - Web Application Server forwards to Authentication Service
   - Authentication Service validates against User Database
   - Session token stored in Session Cache
   - Authentication: OAuth2 with JWT tokens

2. Product Browsing:
   - Customer requests product list from Web Application Server
   - API Gateway queries Product Catalog
   - Product data returned with images from Image Storage
   - Data Classification: Public product information

3. Order Placement:
   - Customer submits order through Web Application Server
   - Order Processing Service validates inventory
   - Payment Gateway processes payment (PCI-compliant)
   - Order stored in Order Database
   - Data Classification: Confidential (payment information)

4. Admin Operations:
   - Store Administrator accesses admin panel
   - Strong authentication required (MFA)
   - Can modify Product Catalog and view Order Database
   - All admin actions logged for audit

Security Considerations:
- All external communications use TLS 1.3
- API endpoints protected with rate limiting
- Input validation on all user inputs
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- GDPR compliance for European customers
- PCI DSS compliance for payment processing
