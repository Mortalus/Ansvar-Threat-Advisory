User: Excellent. Now let's analyze the Threat Generation & Refinement module.

Here is the relevant code from the following files: apps/api/app/api/endpoints/threats.py, apps/api/app/core/pipeline/steps/threat_generator_v3.py, apps/api/app/core/pipeline/steps/threat_refiner.py

Python

// --- Start of apps/api/app/api/endpoints/threats.py ---

Your Task: Analyze this code and list the specific user-facing or API-level functionalities it provides. Be precise. For example: "Threat feedback submission/retrieval/stats", "V3 multi-agent threat generation with CWE context and residual risk", "Executive summary and metrics", "Optimized batch refinement with risk scoring and business statements".
