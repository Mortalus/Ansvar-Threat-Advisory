- **DEBUG**: Detailed technical information (when needed)

## 🔧 **Log Format Standards**

1. **Emojis**: Visual indicators for different types of operations
   - 🚀 Start/initialization
   - ✅ Success/completion
   - ❌ Errors/failures
   - 📊 Statistics/metrics
   - 🔍 Search/retrieval operations

## 🌊 **Flow Visibility**

With these logging improvements, you can now easily trace:

1. **Document Upload** → Text extraction and storage
2. **DFD Extraction** → Component identification and enhancement
3. **DFD Review** → User validation and modifications
4. **Threat Generation** → Multi-agent AI analysis
5. **Threat Refinement** → Risk assessment and business context
6. **Attack Path Analysis** → Security scenario identification

Each step provides clear entry/exit logging with detailed context about what was processed and what was produced.
