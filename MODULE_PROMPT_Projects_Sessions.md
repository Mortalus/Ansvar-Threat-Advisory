User: Excellent. Now let's analyze the Project & Session Management module.

Here is the relevant code from the following files: apps/api/app/api/endpoints/projects.py, apps/api/app/api/endpoints/projects_simple.py, apps/api/app/models/project.py, apps/api/app/services/project_service.py

Python

// --- Start of apps/api/app/api/endpoints/projects.py ---
{{CODE:apps/api/app/api/endpoints/projects.py}}
// --- End of apps/api/app/api/endpoints/projects.py ---

// --- Start of apps/api/app/api/endpoints/projects_simple.py ---
{{CODE:apps/api/app/api/endpoints/projects_simple.py}}
// --- End of apps/api/app/api/endpoints/projects_simple.py ---

// --- Start of apps/api/app/models/project.py ---
{{CODE:apps/api/app/models/project.py}}
// --- End of apps/api/app/models/project.py ---

// --- Start of apps/api/app/services/project_service.py ---
{{CODE:apps/api/app/services/project_service.py}}
// --- End of apps/api/app/services/project_service.py ---


Your Task: Analyze this code and list the specific user-facing or API-level functionalities it provides. Be precise. For example: "Create project", "List projects with session summaries", "Get project details with session tree", "Create/branch/load sessions", "Get session details", "Link session to pipeline", "Update session progress", "Snapshot/branch from snapshot", "Defensive simple projects listing with DB/pipeline/mock fallbacks".
