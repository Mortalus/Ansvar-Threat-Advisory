Of course. Here is the full, consolidated project plan, incorporating all available information including the detailed current project state. This plan is designed to be a definitive strategic document for the development team.

Threat Modeling Platform: Consolidated Project Plan
Document Title: Threat Modeling Platform: Consolidated Project Plan

Version: 2.0

Date: August 8, 2025

Status: Final

1.0 Executive Summary
This document outlines the revised, data-driven project plan for the Threat Modeling Pipeline Platform. The project has achieved a state of exceptional backend maturity, featuring a production-ready, RAG-powered, and modular agent architecture. This engineering foundation is robust, scalable, and secure.

However, a comprehensive review of the current project state has revealed a critical strategic challenge: a disconnect between the advanced, stateful pipeline on the backend and the legacy implementation on the frontend. This gap currently prevents users from realizing the full value of the platform, as completing an end-to-end threat model is not possible.

Therefore, this plan realigns all development priorities. The immediate focus is to unify the platform by bridging the frontend-backend gap, resolving critical security and bug fixes, and delivering the core user value proposition. Once the core experience is stable and complete, the plan systematically builds upon this foundation to deliver the full suite of management, collaboration, and advanced analysis features required for enterprise market leadership.

2.0 Current State Analysis (as of August 8, 2025)
2.1 Strengths & Assets
Production-Ready Backend: An enterprise-grade architecture using Docker, PostgreSQL/pgvector, Celery, and Redis is complete and operationally mature.

Advanced AI Engine: The RAG implementation with CISA KEV and MITRE ATT&CK, Few-Shot Learning, and a customizable Settings API for prompts is fully functional.

Modular Agent Architecture: The agent system is a key differentiator, allowing for extensibility, hot-reloading, health monitoring, and zero-downtime updates.

Comprehensive API Coverage: The backend exposes a rich set of APIs for pipeline management, background tasks, RAG, settings, feedback, and agent management.

Robustness & Resilience: Implemented resilience patterns include circuit breakers, connection pooling, and proper timeout management.

2.2 Identified Gaps & Weaknesses
Critical Frontend/Backend Disconnect: The frontend UI is not using the stateful /api/pipeline/... and /api/tasks/... endpoints. It relies on legacy, stateless document APIs, which breaks the user journey.

Incomplete Management Interfaces: While backend APIs exist, the frontend Admin Hub for managing agents, prompts, and settings is marked as "ðŸš§ PLANNED" and is not implemented. Several agent management backend endpoints are also incomplete.

Missing Core Enterprise Features: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), formal project reporting/export functionality, and explicit multi-user collaboration features are not implemented.

Known Technical Debt & Bugs:

A severe performance bottleneck exists in the agent registry discovery (/api/agents/{agent_name}), causing 50s+ timeouts. A temporary workaround is in place.

Document parsing for .docx files is non-functional.

2.3 Immediate Critical Priorities
Security Vulnerability (P0): An active Scaleway API key is exposed in a configuration file and requires immediate rotation.

Broken User Journey (P1): The frontend/backend API mismatch is the single greatest blocker to user value and must be the top development priority.

3.0 Guiding Principles
Development will be guided by five core principles:

Clarity & Flow: The user journey must be linear, logical, and guided.

Modularity: The system will be composed of independent, extensible components.

Robustness & Data Integrity: The platform must be resilient to failure and enforce data completeness.

Auditability: All significant user actions and data state changes must be versioned and logged.

Accessibility: The platform must be usable by all members of a diverse enterprise team (WCAG 2.1 AA).

4.0 Immediate Actions (Priority 0)
The following actions must be completed before resuming phased development.

Rotate Exposed API Key:

Action: Immediately revoke the exposed Scaleway key and generate a new one. Update the .env file and any other configuration. Conduct a full audit for any other exposed secrets.

Justification: P0 security vulnerability that compromises the integrity of the platform and its data.

Fix DOCX Document Parsing:

Action: Implement and test the document parsing logic for .docx files to bring it to feature parity with PDF and TXT.

Justification: A core feature bug that prevents a significant portion of users from using the platform as intended.

5.0 Phased Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Unify the Platform & Deliver the Core Value Proposition
Objective: Fix the critical frontend/backend disconnect to enable a user to successfully complete one full threat model for the first time, realizing the value of the powerful backend.

Key Initiatives & Features:

Frontend API Refactor: Rearchitect the frontend API client (apps/web/lib/api.ts) and state management (apps/web/lib/store.ts) to exclusively use the modern, stateful backend APIs.

Implement Pipeline-First Workflow: The UI must be modified to call POST /api/pipeline/create at the beginning of a new threat model. The returned pipeline_id must be stored and used for all subsequent steps.

Integrate Background Task Endpoints: All long-running UI actions (e.g., "Start DFD Extraction", "Start Threat Generation") must trigger the POST /api/tasks/execute-step endpoint.

Connect WebSocket Notifications: The frontend must fully utilize the WebSocket connection (/ws/{pipeline_id}) to provide the rich, real-time status updates the backend already emits (e.g., step_started, task_progress, step_completed).

Success Criteria: A user can, for the first time, complete a full threat modeling process from document upload to viewing the refined threat list without errors or interruptions. The UI accurately reflects the real-time status of the backend processing.

Phase 2: Build Out Management & Enterprise Interfaces
Objective: Expose the existing backend management, auditing, and reporting capabilities through a functional and data-rich user interface.

Key Initiatives & Features:

Build the Agent Management Hub UI: Implement the planned frontend components under apps/web/components/admin/, including agent-manager.tsx, agent-configurator.tsx, and the prompt-editor.tsx.

Complete Management Backend: Implement the incomplete agent management APIs (configure, enable, disable) to make the UI fully functional.

Address Agent Registry Performance: Architect and implement a permanent solution for the 50s+ timeout issue. Options include caching discovered agent data in Redis or refactoring the discovery logic to be more performant.

Implement Audit Trail UI: Create a "History" tab within the project view that displays data from the AgentExecutionLog and ThreatFeedback database tables, providing a human-readable audit log.

Implement Reporting & Export: Build the "Generate Report" feature. This UI will trigger a backend process to create and download a comprehensive project report (PDF) and allow raw data exports (JSON, CSV).

Success Criteria: Administrators can configure agents, manage prompts, and view audit logs through the UI. Any user can export a full project report.

Phase 3: Enhance for Teams, Security & Accessibility
Objective: Make the platform secure for multi-user teams, accessible to all enterprise users, and truly collaborative.

Key Initiatives & Features:

Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): This is the highest priority in this phase. Implement a full authentication and session management system. Define user roles (Administrator, Analyst, Viewer) and enforce permissions throughout the UI and API.

Conduct Accessibility Audit & Remediation: Perform a full audit against WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Implement a theme toggle (light/dark mode), ensure full keyboard navigability, add necessary ARIA labels, and confirm color contrast ratios.

Implement Collaboration Features: With RBAC in place, add real-time collaboration features like multi-user cursors/presence indicators in the DFD "Workshop View" and a commenting system for asynchronous feedback.

Success Criteria: The platform supports multiple user roles with distinct permissions. All critical user flows pass a WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility check.

Phase 4: Advanced Analysis & Future Growth
Objective: Deliver on the final product vision by completing all pipeline steps and leveraging the modular architecture for future expansion.

Key Initiatives & Features:

Build Attack Path Analysis UI: Implement the user interface for the final "Attack Path Analysis" step, which is currently a future enhancement.

Build Knowledge Base Management UI: Create an interface for administrators to view statistics, manage, and trigger updates for the RAG knowledge sources.

Build "Custom Agent" Wizard: Create a user-friendly UI that allows administrators to onboard new, custom agents by leveraging the modular backend architecture without requiring code changes.

Success Criteria: All 7 pipeline steps are fully functional with corresponding UIs. The platform's modularity is exposed through a user-facing agent onboarding tool.

6.0 Risk Assessment & Mitigation
Risk 1: Frontend Refactor Complexity.

Description: Rearchitecting the entire frontend data flow is a significant undertaking with the potential for unforeseen complications and delays.

Mitigation: This must be the sole focus of the frontend team during Phase 1. Leverage the existing TypeScript strictness to ensure type safety during the refactor. Implement feature flags if necessary to roll out the new flow incrementally.

Risk 2: Technical Debt in Agent Registry.

Description: The 50s+ timeout issue is a serious performance bottleneck. A permanent fix might be complex and time-consuming.

Mitigation: Allocate dedicated engineering time in Phase 2 for research and implementation of a permanent solution. The existing agents_simple.py workaround can remain in production until the fix is ready, minimizing user impact.

Risk 3: Security Posture.

Description: The discovery of one exposed secret suggests there could be others.

Mitigation: As part of the P0 work, conduct a full secrets audit across the entire codebase. Integrate an automated secrets scanner into the CI/CD pipeline to prevent future occurrences.

7.0 Conclusion
The Threat Modeling Platform is positioned for market leadership due to its outstanding backend architecture. This revised plan provides a clear, actionable path to translate that technical excellence into direct user value. By adopting a "Unify, Expose, Extend" strategyâ€”first unifying the platform, then exposing its power through UIs, and finally extending it with advanced featuresâ€”we can efficiently deliver a secure, robust, and best-in-class product to our enterprise customers.
